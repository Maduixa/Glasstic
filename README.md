### Fasting Zones Explained
- **🍽️ Anabolic (0-4h)**: Digestion and nutrient absorption
- **⚡ Catabolic (4-12h)**: Glycogen breakdown begins
- **🔥 Fat Burning (12-16h)**: Primary fat oxidation phase
- **🧠 Ketosis (16-24h)**: Ketone production for enhanced cognition
- **♻️ Autophagy (24-48h)**: Cellular cleaning and repair
- **✨ Deep Autophagy (48h+)**: Maximum cellular renewal

### Tracking & History
