3. Watch the beautiful gauge fill as you progress through zones
4. Receive AI-generated motivation and education throughout your journey

### Fasting Zones Explained
- **üçΩÔ∏è Anabolic (0-4h)**: Digestion and nutrient absorption
- **‚ö° Catabolic (4-12h)**: Glycogen breakdown begins
- **üî• Fat Burning (12-16h)**: Primary fat oxidation phase
- **üß† Ketosis (16-24h)**: Ketone production for enhanced cognition
- **‚ôªÔ∏è Autophagy (24-48h)**: Cellular cleaning and repair
- **‚ú® Deep Autophagy (48h+)**: Maximum cellular renewal

### Tracking & History
- View your fasting history in the **Calendar** tab
- Edit past fasting sessions by tapping on calendar entries
- Monitor your streak and achievement progress in **Profile**
- Adjust ongoing fast start time with the edit button
